# Design-patterns
This repository contains Java implementations of various design patterns. Design patterns are general reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They provide a blueprint for structuring code and help make your applications more maintainable, scalable, and flexible.

Introduction
In this repository, you will find well-documented Java code examples for each design pattern. Each pattern is explained with a brief description and its use case. We encourage you to explore the code, understand the patterns, and see how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.

creational Design Patterns
creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

Singleton Pattern
Description: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

Factory Method Pattern
Description: Provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.

Abstract Factory Pattern
Description: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Builder Pattern
Description: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

Prototype Pattern
Description: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, thus avoiding the overhead of creating objects from scratch.

Structural Design Patterns
Structural patterns deal with object composition to form larger structures.

Adapter Pattern
Description: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper with a compatible interface.

Bridge Pattern
Description: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently.

Composite Pattern
Description: Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, allowing you to build complex structures.

Decorator Pattern
Description: Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects without modifying their code.

Facade Pattern
Description: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.

Flyweight Pattern
Description: Shares common state between multiple objects to reduce memory usage when there are a large number of similar objects.

Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral patterns deal with the communication and interaction between objects.

Observer Pattern
Description: Establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Strategy Pattern
Description: Allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable at runtime.
