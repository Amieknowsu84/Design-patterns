The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
This pattern encapsulates the various states of an object into separate classes and allows the object to transition between these states dynamically at runtime without changing its interface.

Participants:
Context: This is the object that contains the state. It delegates state-specific behavior to the current state object and may pass itself as an argument to the state object's methods to allow the state to transition the context to a different state.

State: This is the interface or abstract class that defines a set of methods for handling various states. Each concrete state subclass implements these methods to provide behavior specific to that state.

Concrete State: These are the concrete subclasses of the State class. Each concrete state encapsulates the behavior associated with a specific state of the context.

When to Use:
Use the State pattern when an object's behavior changes based on its internal state, and you want to avoid using conditional statements to manage this behavior.
Use it when you have a class that contains a large number of conditional statements that depend on the object's state.
Use it when you want to encapsulate state-specific behavior into separate classes to improve modularity and maintainability.

Benefits:
Encapsulates state-specific behavior into separate classes, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
Eliminates the need for large conditional statements to manage object behavior based on its state.
Allows for easy addition of new states without modifying existing code.

Example:
Consider a vending machine that dispenses different items based on its current state (e.g., "Ready," "OutOfStock," "InsertingCoin").
The State pattern can be used to represent each state as a separate class, with methods for handling events such as inserting a coin or selecting an item.
The context (vending machine) delegates behavior to the current state object, which can change dynamically based on user actions.

Implementation:
To implement the State pattern, you can define a State interface or abstract class that declares methods for handling state-specific behavior.
Each concrete state subclass implements these methods to provide behavior specific to that state. The context object contains a reference to the current state object and delegates state-specific behavior to it.
State transitions can be managed by changing the current state object within the context.

Overall, the State pattern provides a flexible way to manage object behavior based on its internal state, making it a valuable tool for designing systems with complex state-dependent behavior.
