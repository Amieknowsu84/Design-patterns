The Strategy Design Pattern is used when you want to define a family of algorithms,
encapsulate each algorithm, and make them interchangeable.
This pattern allows a client to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime without altering
its structure. You should consider using the Strategy pattern in the following scenarios:

Multiple Algorithms:

Scenario: When you have a family of related algorithms,
 and you want to provide flexibility in choosing the appropriate algorithm at runtime.
Example: Consider a sorting application where you want to support multiple sorting algorithms
 (e.g., QuickSort, MergeSort, BubbleSort).
  Using the Strategy pattern, you can encapsulate each sorting algorithm in a separate strategy class

Avoiding Code Duplication:

Scenario: When you find yourself duplicating code with slight variations to accommodate different behaviors.
Example: In a graphics application,
you might have different drawing tools (e.g., Pencil, Brush, Eraser).
Using the Strategy pattern, you can encapsulate the drawing behavior in separate strategy classes,
avoiding code duplication.

Runtime Algorithm Selection:

Scenario: When you want to select an algorithm at runtime based on specific conditions or user preferences.
Example: In a navigation system, you may have different route-finding algorithms (e.g., Shortest Path, Fastest Route).
Using the Strategy pattern,
you can switch between algorithms based on user preferences or real-time traffic conditions.

Promoting Flexibility:

Scenario: When you want to make a class more flexible by allowing its behavior to be extended or modified without altering its code.
Example: Consider a billing system where you want to apply different discount strategies (e.g., Flat Discount, Percentage Discount).
Using the Strategy pattern, you can define each discount strategy separately and apply it dynamically.


Testing and Maintenance:

Scenario: When you want to simplify testing or maintenance by isolating different algorithms in separate classes.
Example: In a payment processing system, you may have multiple payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe).
Using the Strategy pattern, you can isolate the logic for each payment gateway,
making it easier to test and maintain.
