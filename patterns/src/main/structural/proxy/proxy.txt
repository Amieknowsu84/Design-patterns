The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

Let's assume we have an interface Image representing an image,
 and we want to create a proxy for loading and displaying images lazily:

Image is the interface for the real object (RealImage) and its proxy (ProxyImage).
RealImage is the real object that loads and displays the image.
It does the actual work when the display method is called.
ProxyImage is the proxy class that controls access to the RealImage.
It delays the creation and loading of the RealImage until the display method is called.
This is known as lazy loading.
When the client code requests the display of an image using a proxy,
the real image is only loaded and displayed if it hasn't been loaded before.
This lazy loading behavior is a common use case for the Proxy Pattern,
as it can help improve performance when working with expensive-to-create objects,
such as loading large images from disk or making network requests.

The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
 It has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.
  Here are the pros and cons of using the Proxy Pattern, along with guidance on when to use it:

**Pros:**

1. **Control Access:** Proxies can control access to the real object.
 This is useful when you want to add an extra layer of control over how the object is accessed,
  such as lazy loading, access control, or monitoring.

2. **Lazy Loading:** One of the most common use cases for proxies is lazy loading.
 The real object is created or loaded only when it's actually needed,
  saving resources and improving performance.

3. **Security:** Proxies can enforce access controls and provide an additional layer of security.
 They can restrict certain operations or verify permissions before allowing access to the real object.

4. **Remote Proxies:** Proxy patterns are used in distributed systems to represent objects that are in a different address space.
 Remote proxies handle communication with the remote object,
  hiding the details of network communication.

5. **Caching:** Proxies can cache the results of expensive operations,
 such as database queries or complex calculations,
  and return cached results when the same operation is requested again,
   improving performance.

**Cons:**

1. **Complexity:** Introducing proxies can add complexity to the codebase,
 especially when dealing with multiple layers of proxies or complex proxy logic.

2. **Performance Overhead:** Depending on the proxy's logic,
 there can be a performance overhead compared to direct access to the real object,
  especially if there are additional checks or remote calls involved.

**When to Use the Proxy Pattern:**

1. **Lazy Loading:** Use the Proxy Pattern when you need to implement lazy loading of objects
, meaning that the actual object is only created or loaded when it is needed to conserve resources.

2. **Access Control:** Use proxies to control and restrict access to the real object.
 For example, you can enforce access controls, permissions, or authorization checks.

3. **Monitoring and Logging:** You can use proxies to add monitoring or logging to the behavior of the real object.
 This is particularly useful for debugging or auditing purposes.

4. **Caching:** Proxies can be used to implement caching mechanisms.
They can store and return cached results to reduce the load on the real object and improve performance.

5. **Remote Objects:** In distributed systems or remote communication scenarios,
 you can use remote proxies to represent objects that exist in a different address space,
  abstracting away the details of communication.

6. **Virtual Proxies:** When dealing with large or resource-intensive objects,
 virtual proxies can be used to create lightweight representations until the real object is required.

7. **Smart References:** Proxies can implement reference counting or garbage collection strategies to manage the lifetime of the real object.

In summary, the Proxy Pattern is a versatile design pattern that is especially useful when you need to control access to objects,
 implement lazy loading, add security checks,
 or introduce caching and monitoring mechanisms.
  However, it should be used judiciously to avoid unnecessary complexity and performance overhead.
