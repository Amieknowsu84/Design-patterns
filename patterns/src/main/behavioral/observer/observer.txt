The Observer Design Pattern is used when a subject (or publisher)
 needs to notify a group of observers (or subscribers) about changes in its state.
 This pattern is particularly useful when you have a one-to-many dependency between objects,
 and you want to avoid a tight coupling between them.

 When to Use Observer Design Pattern:

 Decoupling:

 Scenario: When you want to decouple the sender (subject) and receivers (observers)
  so that changes in one do not require changes in the other.
 Example: Consider a stock market application where multiple components
 need to be updated when the stock prices change.
  Using the Observer pattern, each component can register as an observer,
   and the stock market can notify all observers when prices change without needing to know
   the details of each observer.

Distributed Systems:

Scenario: In distributed systems where components may be physically separated
          and need to react to changes in a centralized entity.
Example: In a weather monitoring system with sensors located in different regions,
  each display unit can be an observer of the central weather station.
  When the weather station updates the weather data,
  all display units are automatically notified and updated.

Event Handling:

Scenario: When you need to implement event handling systems
          where multiple entities react to events without explicitly knowing each other.
Example: In a graphical user interface (GUI),
         the Observer pattern is often used for event handling.
         Widgets such as buttons, checkboxes, and sliders
         can be observers of a central event manager.
         When an event occurs, the manager notifies all registered observers.

Dynamic Systems:

Scenario: In systems where the number of observers can change dynamically,
and you want to support loose coupling.
Example: In an online auction system, multiple users may be interested in bidding on an item.
 Each user can be an observer of the auction, and when the bidding status changes,
  all interested users are notified.
